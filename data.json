      "title": "African Eggplant",
      "description": "African eggplant, Solanum aethiopicum, is a deciduous shrub in the family Solanaceae which is grown for its edible fruits which are cooked and eaten as a vegetable. African eggplant is a highly branching plant which can grow up to 2 m (6.6 ft) in height. The leaves of the plant are arranged alternately on the stems and have smooth or lobed margins. Leaf blades may reach up to 30 cm (11.8 in) in length and 21 cm (8.3 in) in width. The leaf petioles are oval or elliptical in shape, reaching up to 11 cm (4.3 in) in length. Plants produce clusters of up to 12 white flowers which develop into egg or spindle-shaped berries which are red to orange in color with a smooth or grooved surface depending on variety. African eggplant may also be referred to as scarlet eggplant, bitter tomato, mock tomato, garden egg or Ethiopian nightshade and is native to Africa, likely resulting from the domestication of a related species, S. anguivi.",
      "scientific_name": "Solanum aethiopicum",
      "common_name:": "african scarlet eggplant, bitter tomato",
      "uses": "African eggplant is grown primarily for its bitter orange-red fruit, which may be eaten boiled, steamed, pickled or in stews with meat and other vegetables. Young leaves are also often used in soups. African eggplants are a source of fiber, potassium, and offer traces of beta-carotene, ascorbic acid, iron, and calcium.",
      "basic_requirements": "Growth requirements for African eggplant vary with variety. All types grow best in full sun and well-draining, deep soils with a pH between 5.5 and 6.8. Gilo types grow best at daytime temperatures between 25 and 35°C (77 and 95°F). Kumba types can grow in hotter temperatures of up to 45°C in low humidity, whereas Shum types require warm and humid conditions in order to thrive. No varieties of African eggplant tolerate very cold or water-logged conditions.",
      "growing": "African eggplant seeds can be collected from fully ripe fruits. Once the seeds have been extracted, they should be laid out on a piece of paper to dry in a place where they are not exposed to direct sunlight. Once dry, seeds can be stored for many years and still remain viable. Seeds should be planted in a prepared nursery bed and should be sown 15 cm (6 in) apart with a further 20 cm (8 in) between rows. Seedlings are ready for transplanting when they reach 15 to 20 cm (6–8 in) in height and have 5–7 leaves. Plants should be hardened prior to transplanting by gradually reducing the amount of water they receive. Plants should be spaced 50 cm (20 in) apart allowing 75 cm (30 in) between rows.",
      "care": "African eggplants will benefit from frequent irrigation during the dry season, particularly when fruiting, to ensure high yields. The crop should be weeded as required to prevent competition. Addition of fertilizer in the form of cattle or chicken or cattle manure or compost will improve yields.",
      "harvesting": "African eggplant is typically ready for harvest 100 to 120 days after planting. The fruit should be harvested before the skin changes color from white to pale yellow when the skin becomes tough. Fruits should be harvested regularly to encourage maximum fruit production. Young leaves may be harvested from 45-60 days of growth."

      "description":"Alfalfa, Medicago sativa, is an herbaceous perennial in the plant family Fabaceae (peas and beans) which is primarily grown as a forage crop which can be grazed by animals or harvested as hay to be used as an animal feed. Alfalfa has a deeply penetrating taproot and the stems of the plant branch from a woody base, growing upright and erect or along the ground. The leaves of the plant are made up of three individual leaflets (trifoliate) which are are narrow and oval or oblong in shape with a smooth upper surface and slightly hairy lower surface. Alfalfa plants produce flowers on racemes (flower stalks) and each raceme possesses 10–35 densely packed purple flowers. Alfalfa produces spirally coiled seed pods each containing 2–6 seeds. Pods may have a smooth or hairy outer surface. Alfalfa plants can reach a height of 120 cm (47 in) and live for between 3 and 8 years. Alfalfa is also commonly referred to as lucerne and is believed to have originated in Caucasus area, north-western Iran and north-eastern Turkey.",
      "scientific_name": "Medicago sativa",
      "common_name:": "lucerne, purple medic",
      "uses":"Alfalfa leaves are edible and can be eaten as a leafy vegetable. Alfalfa is used primarily as forage for animals and is cut and stored as hay or silage. As a legume, the plant fixes nitrogen so can be used to increase nitrogen in the soil and is a commonly used cover crop. Alfafa is a good source of vitamins, calcium, iron, phosphorus and potassium. Besides its use as feed, alfalfa has been traditionally used as a medicinal herb for humans. Its seeds and dried leaves can be consumed as supplements, or sprouted as edible alfalfa sprouts.",
      "basic_requirements": "Alfalfa is adapted to grow in a wide variety of environments but it requires careful management. Alfalfa grows best in deep, fertile, well-draining soils with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. Alfalfa has a deep and vigorous root system and quickly depletes nutrients from the soil. If grown in a soil that is poor in nutrients, the crop may require the addition of copious amounts of fertilizer. The vigorous root system means that alfalfa can tolerate dry periods and still give a good yield.",
      "growing": "Soil should be well prepared prior to planting alfalfa seeds. A firm seedbed is recommended to improve the stand by improving seed contact with the soil. This helps seeds to retain moisture and prevents new roots from drying out. The soil can be firmed prior to planting by using a roller. The seedbed should also be free of weeds and kept moist. Alfalfa fields should be sown 5 cm (2 in) deep in rows spaced 45 to 60 cm (18 to 24 in) apart. Seeds should be watered immediately and the bed kept moist while the seedlings emerge.",
      "care": "The alfalfa stand should be kept free from weeds. The easiest way to achieve this when the crop is being grown on a commercial scale is with the use of a pre-plant herbicide. There are several of these product available for use on alfalfa. Fertilizer should be applied in accordance with soil test results. Lime, phosphorus and potash are the most important nutrients for a healthy alfalfa stand.",
      "harvesting": "Alfalfa is harvested at different times depending on it's intended use. Alfalfa which is cut between thee late bud and early bloom stage generally gives acceptable yields of high quality feed without reducing the quality of the stand. In contrast, repeated harvest of alfalfa which is till in the vegetative stage of growth leads to a reduced stand. In the first year, alfalfa can generally be harvested twice without any detrimental effect on winter survival; once in summer prior to the flowers emerging, and once later in the year with the date depending on location. Alfalfa is usually harvested by combine and baled as hay or cut for direct feeding to animals."

      "description":"The almond tree, Prunus dulcis, is a deciduous tree in the family Rosaceae that is grown for its edible seeds (nuts). The tree has brown or gray bark and either an erect or weeping growth habit, depending on the variety. The trunk can reach 30 cm (12 in) in diameter. Almond leaves are 7.5–13 cm (3–5 in) long with a serrated edge and grow alternately on the branches. The tree produces white to pale pink flowers and hairy green fruits that are oblong in shape. The fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed. The seed is protected by a hard brown shell. At maturity, the flesh of the fruit becomes leathery and splits to reveal the nut inside. Nuts generally measure 3.5 to 6 cm (1.4–2.4 in) in length. Almond trees can reach heights between 4 and 10 m (13 and 33 ft) and have a commercial lifespan of between 30 and 40 years. Almond may be referred to by variety and this includes bitter almond. Almond nuts are generally long and may also be referred to as sweet or bitter almonds, depending on the variety. They originate from wild species found in Central and Southwest Asia.",
      "scientific_name": "Prunus dulcis",
      "common_name:": "Almendras (Span1ish), amandes (French), mandorle (Italian), Mandeln (German), badaam (Indian), لوز (lawz in Arabic) 杏仁 (xìngrén in Mandarin Chinese) and アーモンド (āmondo in Japanese)",
      "uses":"The almond nut is eaten raw or processed into butter, flour, extract, oil, paste, syrup, and milk. Almond oil is used as a flavoring agent in baked goods, perfumery and medicines. Sweet almond oil is used for cosmetic creams and lotions. The hard shells of almonds can serve various functions, such as abrasives and sustainable materials.",
      "basic_requirements": "Almond grows best in Mediterranean climates with warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters. The optimal temperature for their growth is between 15 and 30°C (60–85°F) and the tree buds have a chilling requirement of between 300 and 600 hours below 7.2°C (45°F) to break dormancy. Almond trees will grow best when planted in deep, well-draining loam, although they can withstand drought and grow in poor soils. The trees benefit from being planted in areas sheltered from frost and wind, as trees bloom early and can therefore be susceptible to damage from late frosts. Trees will generally bear nuts after 3 to 4 years, with the nut crop developing after blossoming in the fall.",
      "growing": "",
      "care": "Almond trees will benefit from a layer of mulch around the base to prevent the growth of weeds and conserve soil moisture. Mulch should be spread around the tree in a 1 m (3 ft) radius. Leave a gap between the mulch and the trunk to prevent it from rotting. In addition, an application of fertilizer should be made once in the spring before any new growth and again in the fall.",
      "harvesting": "Almonds are typically harvested in the dry season, usually between August and October. The process begins with shaking the almond trees using mechanical tree shakers or hitting them with a pole, causing the mature almonds to fall to the ground. Once on the orchard floor, the fallen almonds are then collected and put in storage bins or trailers, which will later be transported for processing."

      "description":"Aloe vera is an herbaceous perennial in the family Liliaceae grown for its succulent leaves which have a variety of culinary and medicinal uses. The plant grows best in full sunshine and requires little water for its establishment, growth and reproduction. It prefers areas with mean annual temperatures within the range 19-27°C, but can tolerate temperatures ranging from 10°C to 35°C. The Aloe vera plant has a short, stout stem and a rosette of fleshy, lanceolate leaves which have a serrated margin of small white teeth. The leaves may be flecked with white and are pale green or grey-green in colour. Aloe vera plants produce a conspicuous inflorescence composed of densely packed pendulous yellow flowers on a spike which can be up to 90 cm (35 in) in height. The plant itself can grow to be 1 m (3 ft) in height, it  takes 4-5 years to mature and can live for up to 100 years if well cared for. Aloe vera is indigenous to Eastern and Southern Africa. It belongs to a large class of plants known as “xeroids” characterised for its ability to close its stomata completely to avoid loss of water. This adaptation allows plants to survive long and extreme drought periods.",
      "scientific_name": "Aloe vera (L.) Burm.f. ",
      "common_name:": "true aloe (En); aloès officinal, aloès vrai, aloès vulgaire (Fr); lu hui (Cn); sabila, sávila (Sp)",
      "uses":"Aloe vera plants are grown for medicinal value including improving digestion and boosting the immune system. They are also grown for extraction of the gel inside the leaves. The gel is used in desserts, yoghourts and beverages. The gel is also commonly used as a home remedy for treatment of burns and to prevent constipation. It is also used as a skin and hair nourisher. The plant contains vitamins A (beta-carotene), C and E, which are antioxidants. It also contains vitamin B12 and folic acid.",
      "basic_requirements": "Aloe vera grows best in full sunshine and requires little water for its establishment, growth and reproduction. It prefers areas with mean annual temperatures within the range 19-27°C, but can tolerate temperatures ranging from 10°C to 35°C. It is adapted to areas with mean annual rainfall in the range 700 mm to 3000 mm. During the winter months in the subtropics, the plant becomes dormant and utilizes very little moisture.The pH of the soil should range from 6 to 7.5, and it should be fertile and well-drained",
      "growing": "Aloe Vera can be grown from seeds, but is most easily propagated from suckers which are readily produced by the mother plant. The suckers are commonly referred to as “pups”. The pups should be cut from the main root by gently uprooting the mother plant and finding the point of attachment. The young plant should be cut from the parent using a sharp knife. Pups can be safely removed when they have several sets of leaves. The young plants should be planted in their own pot and watered deeply. Refrain from overwatering to force the growth of new roots. If multiple plants are being planted, provide them with individual pots or plant at least 60 cm (24 in) apart outdoors. When planting using seeds, aim at a spacing of 3ft by 3ft. Spacing is extremely important for high quality harvest. A typical Aloe Vera plant has 25 leaves which extend up to full length of between one foot and 2 feet. This is why experts recommend a minimum spacing of 3 feet all round. Planting the seeds in organic matter-rich, well-drained soil is recommended.",
      "care": "loe plants are generally very easy to care for but care should be taken to avoid overwatering. The plants should be watered deeply but allowed to dry out before the next watering. Check the soil prior to watering. Allow the soil to dry down to a depth of 7.5 to 10 cm (3-4 in) for older, well-established plants or 3.5-5 cm (1-2 in) for younger plants. In addition, although Aloe plants require lots of light, sitting them in full sun can be harmful and it is best to position potted Aloes in a bright window. If the plant is receiving too much sun, the leaves will begin to turn brown.  Aloe vera can tolerate moderate wind conditions, but excessive wind can damage the leaves and lead to dehydration.  Balanced organic or slow-release fertilizers rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium can be applied during the growing stage to support healthy growth.",
      "harvesting": "Aloe plants are usually harvested 4 times per year. The crop takes some 18 to 24 months to mature. Ideally, you should take around three leaves per plant. That comes to a total of 12 leaves per plant every year (keep in mind that only older outer leaves are harvested). You can expect an annual harvest of 60,000 kilograms of Aloe Vera per acre per year."

Amaranths are branching broad-leaved plants with egg-shaped or rhombic leaves which may be smooth or covered in tiny hairs. The leaves have prominent veins, can be green or red in color and have long petioles. The plants produce single flowers on terminal spikes which are typically red to purple in color. Amaranths can reach up to 2.5 m (6.6 ft) in height and are usually grown as annuals, harvested after one growing season. Amaranth may also be referred to as Chinese spinach and their origin is unclear due to their worldwide ",

      "uses":"Amaranth leaves and stems are commonly eaten after cooking in a manner similar to spinach. There are four main species which are cultivated as vegetables; A. cruentus, A. blitum, A. dubius, and A. tricolor. Several species, such as A. caudentis, A. cruentis and A. hypochondriacus are grown as a grain crop in places such as Mexico, Nepal and India and are used to produce cereals and snacks. The leaves are cooked alone or combined with other vegetables. The seeds are grounded into flour or cooked into porridge. The leaves are rich in manganese, calcium, iron, vitamins A, B and C while the seeds are rich in beta-sitosterol and other phytosterols.",
      "basic_requirements": "Amaranth grows from sea level to 2400 m altitude. The different species may suit different altitudes. Normally the hotter it is the better it grows and it generally thrives within a temperature range of 22-30°C. A minimum temperature of 15-17°C is needed for seed germination. Amaranth is grown during both wet and dry seasons, though irrigation is normally required for dry season crops since the rate of transpiration by the leaves is fairly high. Frequent application of water is required, related to the stage of growth of the crop and the moisture-retaining capacity of the soil. It can however tolerate periods of drought after the plant has become established. It is adapted to low to medium humidity. Amaranth grows best in loam or silty-loam soils with good water-holding capacity, but it can grow on a wide range of soil types and soil moisture levels. Amaranth can tolerate a soil pH from 4.5 to 8.  ",
      "growing": "Amaranths are propagated from seed and can be planted either by transplanting or direct seeding. Certified seeds with special attributes, such as tolerance/resistance to pest and diseases and high yielding should be used. Indirect seeding, seeds are either broadcasted or sown in rows at 0.5 to 1.0 g per m2 of bed. Since Amaranth seeds are very small, seeds are mixed with sand at a ratio of 1g seed to 100g sand for easy sowing and uniform stand. Farmers can instead choose to mix 1 part of amaranth seeds to 4 parts of chicken manure or ash. Seeds should be sown to a depth of 1–2 cm (0.4–0.8 in) in rows spaced 50 cm (20 in) apart and covered with a very light layer of soil.  When the seeds germinate allow them to grow for one week. before thinning the plants to keep 20 cm (8 in) spacing from each other. ",
      "care": "Amaranth is easy to care for and requires little maintenance. While the seedlings are young, it is important to remove any weeds from around the plants to prevent competition. Applying a layer of mulch will help to prevent weeds and conserve soil moisture. The plants will benefit from supplemental irrigation during dry periods and the addition of fertilizer once or twice throughout the growing season.160 kg/acre of NPK 10–10–20 is recommended. The crop should be top dressed to promote better re-growth with CAN at monthly intervals. 15 days after transplanting, apply N at 20kg/acre as top-dressing. ",
      "harvesting": "Amaranth leaves are harvested by thinning and clipping. During thinning, the whole plant is uprooted. Thinning starts 2-3 weeks after germination or when the plant has 6-8 fully grown leaves. Leaves can also be clipped at regular intervals. Clipping may starts 3-4 weeks after germination. The tender leaves are clipped once a week until the onset of flowering. Frequent harvest prolongs the harvest period and delays onset of flowering. Grain amaranth varieties are usually ready to harvest after about three months. The flowers can simply be cut from the plant using a pair of scissors and set in a warm, dry place to finish drying out. When the flowers are dry, seeds can be removed by brushing or by beating the flowers in a bag. Passing the beaten flowers through a fine screen mesh can help to remove the seeds from the chaff."

Slices can be dried for later consumption. Apples can also be used for the extraction of useful compounds such as fructose and pectin. Apples are rich in fiber, Vitamin C, minerals, and antioxidants. Apples are a great source of soluble fiber, which can help reduce intestinal disorders. They also aid in controlling insulin levels by slowly releasing sugar into the bloodstream. Additionally, apples can lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of respiratory diseases. They are also known for their ability to detoxify and cleanse the body. Furthermore, apples have been traditionally used to treat conditions such as fever, dysentery, diarrhea, and constipation.",
      "basic_requirements": "Apple trees grow best in the tropics and at higher latitudes. They require a mild growing season and a cold winter to break their dormancy. In these latitudes, the tree will flower in spring and the fruit will ripen in the fall. In the tropics, the leaves will remain on the tree longer, making it essentially evergreen, and flowering and fruiting will happen sporadically throughout the year unless the tree manages to enforce a uniform cycle across the entire tree by bending shoots to create a wide tree. Apple trees require fertile, well-drained, and well-aerated loamy-sandy soil, with a slightly acidic to alkaline pH of 5.5-6.5. You must test your soil before planting and amend it with organic matter, lime, or sulfur if necessary. Apples require a lot of moisture during the flowering and fruiting stage. Therefore, if you are growing apples in hotter regions, you will need to irrigate your trees. However, keep in mind that excess water around the root zone will encourage disease outbreaks and result in low crop yield. The best method of irrigating apples is through drip irrigation.",
      "growing": "When planted from a seed, an apple tree can take six to ten years to mature and produce fruit of its own. Apple trees are small to medium-sized, reaching heights of 5–10 m (16.4–32.8 ft), with a central trunk that divides into several branches. The leaves of the tree are oval in shape and can reach up to 13 cm (5.1 in) in length and 7 cm (2.8 in) in width. The standard method of propagating apple trees is by budding. When planting an apple nursery or orchard, it is highly advisable to plant seedlings budded from rootstock to prevent an increase in bud dormancy. Budded trees should be pruned in the first year to encourage new shoot growth. ",
      "care": "In the tropics, apple trees require careful management to make heavy crop loads sustainable. This includes bending shoots, pruning the tips, and defoliating the trees. Flowers are also removed to promote growth until the first fruit production, generally after 2 years.",
      "harvesting": "An apple is ready for picking when its background skin color turns from green to yellow. The fruit comes off easily when harvested. Harvesting apples at the right time is key, not only to obtain the highest quality fruit but also to maximize the storage life. Maturation time is dependent on weather conditions during the growing season. Early maturing apples are harvested in August-September. There are several reasons why proper picking technique is important. First, simply pulling apples from the tree with force is likely to bruise the fruit and remove the stems. Apples without stems do not store as well as apples with stems. Second, it is easy to identify apples that have been picked incorrectly. They will have noticeable fingerprint bruises. Make sure to palm instead of grab when picking. Yanking tends to remove spurs from the tree. These fruit spurs represent next year's crop, so by pulling them off, there will be fewer apples to harvest next year. In addition to not pulling the apples from the tree, there are some other actions that are important to avoid. Apples that have touched the ground are a potential source of contamination. Never mix apples from the ground with picked apples. Apples that are decaying or rotten should be dropped on the ground and never placed in your bin. Do not throw or drop apples into your bucket, as this will certainly cause bruising. And always avoid squeezing the fruit when picking.",
