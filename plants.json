        "description":"An apple is a deciduous tree grown for its fruits, known as apples. Apple fruits are one of the most widely cultivated fruits in the world. They are round (pome) in shape and range in color from green to red. The domestic apple tree is believed to have originated from Western Asia and the Mediterranean, having several wild ancestors. China is the largest producer of apples worldwide. Apple farming can be profitable and rewarding for farmers with suitable land, climate, and markets.",
        "scientific_name": "Malus domestica",
        "common_name:": "Apple tree (En)",
        "uses":"Apples are most commonly eaten fresh but can also be used for baking and cooking. They can be processed into applesauce, cider, vinegar, juice, or butter. Slices can be dried for later consumption. Apples can also be used for the extraction of useful compounds such as fructose and pectin. Apples are rich in fiber, Vitamin C, minerals, and antioxidants. Apples are a great source of soluble fiber, which can help reduce intestinal disorders. They also aid in controlling insulin levels by slowly releasing sugar into the bloodstream. Additionally, apples can lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of respiratory diseases. They are also known for their ability to detoxify and cleanse the body. Furthermore, apples have been traditionally used to treat conditions such as fever, dysentery, diarrhea, and constipation.",
        "basic_requirements": "Apple trees grow best in the tropics and at higher latitudes. They require a mild growing season and a cold winter to break their dormancy. In these latitudes, the tree will flower in spring and the fruit will ripen in the fall. In the tropics, the leaves will remain on the tree longer, making it essentially evergreen, and flowering and fruiting will happen sporadically throughout the year unless the tree manages to enforce a uniform cycle across the entire tree by bending shoots to create a wide tree. Apple trees require fertile, well-drained, and well-aerated loamy-sandy soil, with a slightly acidic to alkaline pH of 5.5-6.5. You must test your soil before planting and amend it with organic matter, lime, or sulfur if necessary. Apples require a lot of moisture during the flowering and fruiting stage. Therefore, if you are growing apples in hotter regions, you will need to irrigate your trees. However, keep in mind that excess water around the root zone will encourage disease outbreaks and result in low crop yield. The best method of irrigating apples is through drip irrigation.",
        "growing": "When planted from a seed, an apple tree can take six to ten years to mature and produce fruit of its own. Apple trees are small to medium-sized, reaching heights of 5–10 m (16.4–32.8 ft), with a central trunk that divides into several branches. The leaves of the tree are oval in shape and can reach up to 13 cm (5.1 in) in length and 7 cm (2.8 in) in width. The standard method of propagating apple trees is by budding. When planting an apple nursery or orchard, it is highly advisable to plant seedlings budded from rootstock to prevent an increase in bud dormancy. Budded trees should be pruned in the first year to encourage new shoot growth. ",
        "care": "In the tropics, apple trees require careful management to make heavy crop loads sustainable. This includes bending shoots, pruning the tips, and defoliating the trees. Flowers are also removed to promote growth until the first fruit production, generally after 2 years.",
        "harvesting": "An apple is ready for picking when its background skin color turns from green to yellow. The fruit comes off easily when harvested. Harvesting apples at the right time is key, not only to obtain the highest quality fruit but also to maximize the storage life. Maturation time is dependent on weather conditions during the growing season. Early maturing apples are harvested in August-September. There are several reasons why proper picking technique is important. First, simply pulling apples from the tree with force is likely to bruise the fruit and remove the stems. Apples without stems do not store as well as apples with stems. Second, it is easy to identify apples that have been picked incorrectly. They will have noticeable fingerprint bruises. Make sure to palm instead of grab when picking. Yanking tends to remove spurs from the tree. These fruit spurs represent next year's crop, so by pulling them off, there will be fewer apples to harvest next year. In addition to not pulling the apples from the tree, there are some other actions that are important to avoid. Apples that have touched the ground are a potential source of contamination. Never mix apples from the ground with picked apples. Apples that are decaying or rotten should be dropped on the ground and never placed in your bin. Do not throw or drop apples into your bucket, as this will certainly cause bruising. And always avoid squeezing the fruit when picking.",

The pomegranate tree is branched and spiny with glossy, leathery, oval to oblong leaves that grow in whorls of five or more on the branches. The tree produces bright red flowers singly at the tips of the branches and a rounded hexagonal fruit with a thick pink-red skin. The fruit has a thick, leathery rind which protects the pulp[ and seeds inside. The inside of the fruit is separated into compartments by white spongy tissue. Each compartment contains seeds and pulp. Each pomegranate fruit may contain as many as 600 seeds. Pomegranate trees can reach a height of 10 m (33 ft) and can be very long lived, although their economic lifespan is usually between 12 and 15 years. Pomegranate may also be referred to as grenadine or Chinese apple and originated from Central Asia, likely in Iran. ",

Fully mature fruit turn bright red in color and make a metallic sound when tapped. Fruits should be harvested by cutting from the tree.",
      "care": "Pomegranates have a similar water requirement to citrus trees and should be provided with additional irrigation during dry periods. Pomegranate orchards usually utilize drip, furrow or sprinkler irrigation systems to promote optimal yields.

The leaves display a variety of characteristic depending on the species, some are evergreen whereas some have leaves that will die and fall off in winter. The plant produces flower stalks from the crown and the the flowers are white in color. The fruit of the plant is red and fleshy with small seeds on the outside. Strawberry can grow 20–25 cm (8–10 in) in height and has an economic life of 2–4 years before the plants are replaced.

They can be grown successfully in a wide variety of soils from sandy soils to silty clay but will grow best in a deep, well draining loam rich in organic matter. The optimum pH for their growth is between 5.5 and 6.5. If drainage is poor then it is recommended to plant strawberry on beds raised by a minimum of 15–20 cm (6–8 in).",
      "care": "In the first growing season after planting, the plants should not be allowed to produce fruit in order for the plants to concentrate their energy of vegetative growth. Pinch off any flowers as they are produced. Fruit can be harvested in the year after planting. When the desired density of plants is reached cut off any runners or cultivate with a hoe. Weeds should also be removed from the strawberry bed regularly. Strawberry plants also require adequate moisture and should receive 2.5–3.8 cm (1–1.5 in) of water per week either from rainfall or irrigation if needed.
